      <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher specialized in the use of machine and deep learning techniques for the exploitation of large astronomical datasets.
         I hold a PhD in Astrophysics from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) and currently work at the Centro de Astrobiolog√≠a (CAB) as 
         a postdoctoral researcher for the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>
        
      <p>My research focuses on three main areas:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>M dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs parameter determination</strong>: Developing deep transfer learning approaches using autoencoder neural 
          networks to estimate atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and rotational velocity) of M dwarfs from 
          high-resolution CARMENES spectra, bridging the gap between synthetic models and observed data. Applying the same methodology to low-resolution spectroscopy
          to determine the effective temperature of ultracool dwarfs.</li>

        <li><strong>Detailed morphology of galaxies in clusters</strong>: Using visual morphology classifications, obtained with the <a href="https://zoobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">
          Zoobot</a> deep learning classifier, to study the evolution of different galaxy morphologies in high density environments in the Euclid survey.</li>


        <li><strong>Identification and characterisation of low-mass objects</strong>: Enabling Virtual Observatory methodologies to efficiently identify 
          ultracool dwarf candidates in wide-field surveys.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>In summary, this research explores how data-driven approaches, combining Virtual Observatory infrastructure with artificial intelligence, can transform astronomical 
        research by enabling the automated analysis of vast datasets from current and future surveys.</p>

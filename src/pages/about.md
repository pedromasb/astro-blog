## Career & Research Focus

I am a researcher specializing in the discovery and characterization of low-mass stellar and substellar objects, with particular expertise in M dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs. My work combines Virtual Observatory technologies with machine learning and deep learning techniques to address the challenges posed by the exponential growth of astronomical data.

My research focuses on three main areas:

- **Ultracool dwarf discovery and characterization**: Developing Virtual Observatory methodologies to efficiently identify ultracool dwarf candidates in wide-field surveys like J-PLUS, increasing the known population by ~135% in surveyed regions through automated data mining techniques.

- **Stellar parameter determination**: Creating deep transfer learning approaches using autoencoder neural networks to estimate atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and rotational velocity) of M dwarfs from high-resolution CARMENES spectra, bridging the gap between synthetic models and observed data.

- **Stellar activity detection**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to systematically detect flare events in M dwarfs using multi-filter photometric surveys, including the identification of strong Ca II H and K line emission episodes that have implications for exoplanetary habitability studies.

My work demonstrates how data-driven approaches, combining Virtual Observatory infrastructure with artificial intelligence, can transform astronomical research by enabling the automated analysis of vast datasets from current and future surveys like Euclid and LSST.

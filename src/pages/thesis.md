## Abstract

<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap leading-relaxed">
Low-mass objects are ubiquitous in our Galaxy. Their low temperature provides them with complex atmospheres characterised by the presence of strong molecular absorption bands which, together with their faintness, have made their accurate characterisation a great challenge for astronomers over the last decades. M dwarfs account for 75\% of the census of stars within 10 pc of the Sun, and their suitability as targets in the search for Earth-like planets has led many research groups to focus on the study of these objects, which is crucial for the understanding of the structure and kinematics of our Galaxy. Very low-mass stars and substellar objects with spectral types M7 or later, including the extended L, T, and Y spectral types, constitute the domain of ultracool dwarfs. The study of these objects, discovered definitively in 1995, is key for understanding the boundary between stellar and substellar objects and promises to experience a quantum leap thanks to the characteristics of new-generation surveys such as *Euclid* or LSST.

Data analysis in the field of observational astronomy has undergone a paradigm shift during the last decades driven by an exponential growth in the volume and complexity of available data. In this revolution, the Virtual Observatory has become a cornerstone providing a system that fosters data access and interoperability between astronomical archives around the world. In response to this growth in data complexity, the astronomical community has increasingly adopted machine and deep learning techniques for the development of scalable, automated solutions capable of analysing huge amounts of data in an efficient way.

This thesis explores the discovery and characterisation of M dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs, always using a data-driven approach supported by Virtual Observatory technologies and protocols. We rely on a variety of machine and deep learning techniques to develop flexible methodologies aimed at advancing our understanding of M dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs in the coming years. In this context, we use J-PLUS multi-filter photometry to enrich the ultracool dwarf census by providing a characterised catalogue of candidates. In addition, we consolidate a novel deep transfer learning methodology to determine atmospheric stellar parameters of M dwarfs from high-resolution spectra, and provide new estimations for a sample of M dwarfs observed by the CARMENES survey. We demonstrate that this methodology can also be extended to the ultracool dwarf domain by adapting it to low-resolution spectroscopic data.

We expect that the work carried out in this thesis will lay the foundations for future advances in the low-mass domain. We make available to the astronomical community all the catalogues and methodologies developed throughout the thesis, in the hope that future researchers will find them valuable resources to advance the knowledge of these faint, cool, low-mass objects that populate our Universe.</p>

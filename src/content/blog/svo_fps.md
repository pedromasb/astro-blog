In this work, published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, we present the power of the [Spanish Virtual Observatory](https://svo.cab.inta-csic.es/main/index.php) Filter Profile Service and associated photometric tools, and demonstrate their power to segregate FGK dwarf and giant stars using narrow-band photometry. Using machine-learning techniques such as the Gaussian mixture model and the support vector machine algorithms, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars, selecting the five most promising colour-colour diagrams for this task and defining a criteria to maximise the separation.

### Abstract
>>
Aims. This paper is focused on the segregation of FGK dwarf and giant stars through narrow-band photometric data using the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) Filter Profile Service and associated photometric tools. 
>>
Methods. We selected spectra from the MILES, STELIB, and ELODIE stellar libraries, and used SVO photometric tools to derive the synthetic photometry in 15 J-PAS narrow filters, which were especially selected to cover spectral features sensitive to gravity changes. Using machine-learning techniques as the Gaussian mixture model and the support vector machine, we defined several criteria based on J-PAS colours to discriminate between dwarf and giant stars.
>>
Results. We selected five colour-colour diagrams that presented the most promising separation between both samples. Our results show an overall accuracy in the studied sample of ~0.97 for FGK stars, although a dependence on the luminosity type and the stellar effective temperature was found. We also defined a colour-temperature relation for dwarf stars with effective temperatures between 4 000 and 7 000 K, which allows one to estimate the stellar effective temperature from four J-PAS filters (J0450, J0510, J0550, and J0620). Additionally, we extended the study to M-type giant and dwarf stars, achieving a similar accuracy to that for FGK stars.

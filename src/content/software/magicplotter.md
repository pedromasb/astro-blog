MagicPlotter is a Streamlit web appplication that allows the user to create and share interactive visualizations in record time and without writing any code. It is the culmination of a research process focused on developing new ways to enhance the use of interactive visualizations within the research community, sometimes adding great value to the presentation of results.

 After surveying several colleagues in the astronomical community, the results were that most people are interested in this subject, but lack the time to acquire the necessary technical background for it. MagicPlotter solves this bottleneck by providing an interface between the user and the Python code needed to create the interactive visualisations, allowing the creation of plots without the need to write any code.

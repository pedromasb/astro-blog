Moreover, for late M-dwarfs (M5 or later), the outermost layers of the atmosphere are cool enough to form dust and clouds, which makes the modelling of these atmospheres and the consequent determination of their stellar parameters even more complex. This is further aggravated by the inherent faintness of M dwarfs, which makes it difficult to obtain high-S/N, high-resolution spectra, and their frequent manifestation of strong stellar activity. Despite these problems, numerous efforts have been devoted to estimating photospheric parameters in M dwarfs, including effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity.

While machine learning refers to all systems that automatically learn from the data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so, deep learning focuses on multi-layered neural networks that automatically extract features and create a hierarchical representation of the data. In traditional machine learning, an essential step is feature engineering, where domain experts manually select or design the most relevant features from raw data to improve model performance. For example, in the classification of stellar spectra, an astronomer might compute spectral indices such as the TiO and VO band strengths to distinguish between different M dwarf spectral types. These indices serve as handcrafted features that are then used by machine learning models like support vector machines or decision trees. In contrast, deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks, automatically extract relevant features from raw data without requiring manual input. For instance, instead of relying on predefined spectral indices, a convolutional neural network trained on stellar spectra is capable of learning patterns directly from the full spectrum, identifying subtle absorption lines and continuum variations that may be difficult to define explicitly. This automatic feature extraction can enhance classification accuracy and reveal new insights that might be overlooked with traditional methods. Depending on the nature of the problem to be addressed, machine learning algorithms fall into different categories.

The distinctive factor of convolutional neural networks is the use of convolution operations, in the convolutional layers, to automatically extract features from data. After the convolutional structure, the set of features is flattened and passed to a multilayer perceptron to predict the output of the layer. In each forward pass process, the input of each unit of the convolutional layer is obtained with an element-wise dot product between a set of weights known as convolution kernel or filter, and the output feature maps of the previous layer (see Figure ). In a same layer, different units use different filters. The resulting arrays and a tunable bias are added up and passed through an activation function to obtain the output feature map of each unit. The set of weights of each kernel and the weights of the multilayer perceptron are adjusted in the training process, so that the different feature maps of the convolutional layers represent specific features detected in the input data\\, .

This is the case, for example, when a classification or regression task is to be performed on a small labelled sample. A straightforward, and widely used in astronomy, solution to this problem is the use of a data-rich labelled dataset similar to the target dataset or of synthetic data to train the deep learning models, but this may include a systematic error in the methodology if the training set is not identical to the observed data on which the inference is made (CITATION) . Transfer learning, in which knowledge is transferred from a rich source domain to a related but not identical target domain, plays a key role in solving the above problems. Knowledge transfer is typically performed by training a deep learning model on a data-rich dataset and then fine-tuning the neural network weights using the target dataset (CITATION) . Another approach to this problem is the use of active learning (CITATION) , which reduces the number of required training samples by selecting the most informative data to label.

This means that objects with good photometry but poor astrometry will be excluded from the lists of candidate UCDs. To solve this limitation, in this section we describe a method solely dependent on photometric information. This procedure consisted of two separate steps. First, we built a colour-colour diagram with the purpose of defining a colour cut to identify the UCD locus. Then, we applied this criterion to each 20 [MATH] 20\\,deg [MATH] region independently to obtain a shortlist of candidate UCDs.

We explored the ability to reproduce the presented search for candidate UCDs with a purely ML-based methodology that uses only J-PLUS photometry. Because the sample is strongly imbalanced, as a first step in the candidate UCDs identification, we proposed a filtering strategy to discard the objects that differ the most from the UCDs using the PCA algorithm. Then, with the reduced sample, SVM models were trained and fine-tuned to maximise the identification of candidate UCDs. Principal component analysis (CITATION) , one of the most popular linear dimensionality reduction algorithms, is a non-parametric method that aims to reduce a complex data set to a lower dimension by identifying the axes that account for the largest amount of variance. The unit vectors defining each of these axes are called principal components. PCA works on the assumption that principal components with larger associated variance encompass the underlying structure of the data set in order to find the best basis for re-expressing it. The expectation behind this method, as with any method of dimensionality reduction, is that the entire data set can be well characterised along a small number of dimensions (principal components). By projecting the data set onto the hyperplane defined by these principal components, you ensure that the projection will preserve as much variance as possible. The selection of PCA in our approach instead of other non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding []{vandermaaten08} or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection []{McInnes2018}, is mainly based on (1) the computational efficiency, since PCA allows projecting new data along the new axes without having to reapply the algorithm, and (2) the deterministic nature of the PCA solution, i.e., different runs of PCA on a given dataset will", "type": "body", "page": -1, "chapter_key": "2", "chapter": "Ultracool Dwarfs in J-PLUS", "section_key": "2.5", "section": "Machine learning analysis", "subsection_key": null, "subsection": null, "thesis_part": "Methods/Results", "chunk_idx": 0, "chunk_total": 2}

These properties of PCA are crucial in our proposal, since we use the 2D representation of PCA to perform the filtering as a first step in our ML task. Support vector machine is a supervised (requires labelled training data) ML algorithm that has been widely used in classification and regression problems (CITATION) . The origin of this algorithm dates back to the late 70s, when (CITATION) delved into the statistical learning theory. The idea behind SVM is to find a hyperplane that separates data into two classes while maximising a marging, defined as the distance from the hyperplane to the closest point across both classes. Thus, the SVM chooses the best separating hyperplane as the one that maximises the distance to these points, so the decision surface is fully specified by a subset of points on the inner edge of each class, known as support vectors. The SVM is a linear classifier, so if the data is not linearly separable in the instance space, we can gain linear separation by mapping the data to a higher dimensional space. To do so, different kernels are used, such as the polynomial or the radial basis function (RBF), since the kernel trick allows us to define a high-dimensional feature space without actually storing these features.", "type": "body", "page": -1, "chapter_key": "2", "chapter": "Ultracool Dwarfs in J-PLUS", "section_key": "2.5", "section": "Machine learning analysis", "subsection_key": null, "subsection": null, "thesis_part": "Methods/Results", "chunk_idx": 1, "chunk_total": 2}

In this context, transfer learning could play an important role in mitigating uncertainties in the results due to the synthetic gap (i.e. difference in feature distributions between observed and synthetic data). We propose a feature-based deep transfer learning (DTL) approach based on autoencoders to determine stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra. Using this methodology, we provide new estimations for the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for 286 M dwarfs observed by the CARMENES survey. Using autoencoder architectures, we projected synthetic PHOENIX-ACES spectra and observed CARMENES spectra onto a new feature space of lower dimensionality in which the differences between the two domains are reduced. We used this low-dimensional new feature space as input for a convolutional neural network to obtain the stellar parameter determinations. We performed an extensive analysis of our estimated stellar parameters, ranging from 3050 to 4300\\,K, 4.7 to 5.1\\,dex, and [MATH] 0.53 to 0.25\\,dex for [MATH] , log g, and [Fe/H], respectively.

We consolidated a DTL-based methodology to determine stellar parameters in M dwarfs from synthetic spectra, with no need for high-quality measurements involved in the knowledge transfer.

However, well-established photometric and spectroscopic methods for determining these parameters encounter particular challenges, mainly due to the inherent faintness of M dwarfs and their frequent manifestation of strong stellar activity. Specifically for spectroscopic analyses, establishing the spectral continuum can be a difficult task. Despite these problems, numerous efforts have been devoted to estimating photospheric parameters in M dwarfs, including effective temperature ( [MATH] ), surface gravity (log g), and metallicity ([M/H]). Several methods have proven successful in inferring these parameters, such as fitting synthetic spectra, as in [hereafter Pass19]{pass2019} and [hereafter Mar21]{mar21}, pseudo-equivalent widths (pEWs) []{Mann2013,Mann2014,Neves2014}, spectral indices []{RojasAyala2010,Rojas2012}, empirical calibrations []{casagrande08,Neves2012}, interferometry []{Boyajian2012,Rabus2019}, and machine learning [hereafter Pass20]{Antoniadis2020,pass20}. The approaches based on pEWs, measurements of the strength of absorption lines in a spectrum, and spectral indices, calculated from carefully chosen spectral regions --and often derived from absorption lines or bands--, leverage their sensitivity and correlation with stellar parameters (mainly, [MATH] and [Fe/H]). As a recent example of these approaches, (CITATION) determined [MATH] and metallicities, among other parameters, for 53 M dwarfs using H- and K-band pEWs and H [MATH] O indices. Another approach relies on empirical calibrations based on observations of M dwarfs that have an F, G, or K binary companion with known metallicity. This is grounded in the idea that the metallicity of an M dwarf is comparable to that of the hotter primary star, assuming the system originated from the same proto-stellar cloud (CITATION) .

In this work, we present a novel transfer learning approach for estimating photospheric parameters in M dwarfs based on their stellar spectra. The primary goal of the proposed method is to address the aforementioned limitation identified by (CITATION) by eliminating the requirement for interferometric values in the knowledge transfer process. To achieve this, instead of employing a model-based transfer learning approach, as in (CITATION) , where the transferred knowledge is encoded into model parameters, priors or model architectures, we propose a feature-based transfer learning. In this approach, the knowledge to be transferred can be considered as the learned feature representation. The idea is to learn a `good' feature representation so that, by projecting data onto the new representation, the differences between domains (source and target, i.e. synthetic and observed spectra in our case) can be reduced.

In some fields, such as astrophysics, building a large, annotated data set can be incredibly complex and expensive. A straightforward and widely used solution to this problem is the use of synthetic data to train the DL models, but this may include a systematic error in the methodology if the synthetic gap (see Section ) is significant, as is the case in this work. Transfer learning (TL) plays a key role in solving the above problems, as it allows knowledge to be transferred from a rich source domain to a related but not identical target domain. The transition from TL to DTL, with incomplete DTL as an intermediate stage []{yu2022}, came with the integration of DL techniques into the TL paradigm. In the context of TL, a domain can be represented as [MATH] , where [MATH] denotes a feature space and [MATH] represents the marginal probability distribution for [MATH] . Also, a task can be represented as [MATH] , where [MATH] denotes a label space and [MATH] is a predictive function. According to the definition provided by (CITATION) , given a source domain [MATH] and task [MATH] , and a target domain [MATH] and task [MATH] , TL aims to enhance the performance of a predictive function [MATH] in [MATH] , using the knowledge available in [MATH] and [MATH] , where [MATH] and/or [MATH] .

The motivation for keeping the lower layers frozen is to prevent generic learning from being overwritten, thus preserving the knowledge acquired by the network to recognise relevant spectral features, while the more specific features are tailored to the target domain (CITATION) . (CITATION) already explored the possibility of finding a low-dimensional latent space in which source and domain data are close to each other, and using it as a bridge to transfer the knowledge from the labelled source domain to the unlabelled target domain.

They are a specific class of multilayered feedforward neural networks, initially developed for image classification and visual pattern recognisition (CITATION) . The distinctive factor of CNNs is the use of convolution operations, in the convolutional layers, to automatically extract features from data. After the convolutional structure, the set of features is flattened and passed to an artificial neural network (ANN) to perform the classification or regression task. In each forward-propagation process, the input of each neuron of the convolutional layer is obtained with an element-wise dot product between a convolution kernel (or filter), with trainable coefficients, and the outputs of the previous layer. The resulting arrays and a tunable bias are added up and passed through an activation function to obtain the output feature map of the neuron. The set of kernels is tuned during the training process, as the weights of the deep ANN layers are adjusted, so that the different feature maps of the layer represent specific features detected in the input data.

(CITATION) developed a model-based DTL technique to bridge the significant differences in flux features between the two spectral families, reported by (CITATION) . Here, we propose a parallel feature-based DTL strategy that addresses the limitations mentioned in their work regarding the need for high-quality stellar parameter estimations in the knowledge transfer process. Using a methodology that combines the use of AEs and CNNs, we derived new estimations for the stellar parameters [MATH] , log\\, [MATH] , [M/H], and [MATH] of 286 M dwarfs observed with CARMENES. The AE models were trained on PHOENIX-ACES synthetic spectra and then fine-tuned using the CARMENES high-S/N, high-resolution spectra. In the fine-tuning process, no data other than the observed spectra are required, which gives our methodology great flexibility, as no measured stellar parameters are involved in the knowledge transfer. We used the low-dimensional representations of the synthetic and observed spectra, resulting from the initial training and the fine-tuning steps, respectively, as input to the CNNs for the estimation of the stellar parameters. In this way, parameter estimation is conducted using a dataset in which no significant differences in the feature distributions between the synthetic and observed data are evident. We performed an in-depth analysis of our estimated stellar parameters, using the diagram shown in Fig. to study the objects that deviate from the main sequence.

In recent years, astronomy is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by an exponential growth in observational data, with new-generation surveys that have produced vast amounts of information that have pushed traditional methods of data analysis to their limits. We address this challenge by exploring the application of machine and deep learning techniques, in combination with Virtual Observatory technologies, for the development of methodologies to advance our understanding of M dwarfs and ultracool dwarfs in the years to come. The results obtained reinforce the growing role of machine learning in astronomy, highlighting its transformative potential for handling large astronomical datasets, and advocate data-driven approaches that combine Virtual Observatory technologies with machine and deep learning techniques as the way forward for the future of observational astronomy.

Combining multi-filter photometry from several surveys and astrometric data, we consolidated a Virtual Observatory methodology to efficiently identify ultracool dwarf candidates in wide-field surveys and subsequently characterise them. Using this approach, we provided a catalogue of ultracool dwarfs over the entire sky coverage of the J-PLUS second data release, increasing the number of ultracool dwarfs reported in this region by [MATH] \\,\\%. We demonstrated how a machine learning approach could accelerate this process, which is an important achievement considering the application of this methodology to larger and deeper surveys such as J-PAS and Euclid. In this sense, future work could be focused in mitigating the main limitations of the developed methodology, which is based on a combination of principal component analysis and support vector machines, namely the significant number of false positives obtained prior to the determination of the effective temperature. An approach involving cost-sensitive learning techniques (CITATION) could be the way forward. We consolidated a deep transfer learning approach, based on autoencoder neural networks, to determine atmospheric stellar parameters of M dwarfs from high-resolution spectra. Using this methodology, we provided new estimations for the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for 286 M dwarfs observed by the CARMENES survey, mitigating the deviations in previous works attributed to the differences between synthetic and observed data. Since no other data than the observed spectra are required in the transfer learning process, our methodology proves to be very flexible and represents a significant step forward in bridging the synthetic gap in stellar parameter estimation from synthetic spectra.

Since no other data than the observed spectra are required in the transfer learning process, our methodology proves to be very flexible and represents a significant step forward in bridging the synthetic gap in stellar parameter estimation from synthetic spectra. We further demonstrated this by successfully adapting the procedure to the low-resolution domain to estimate the effective temperature of ultracool dwarfs using near-infrared spectra from SpeX Prism Library. We demonstrated the potential of multi-filter photometric surveys to systematically detect flare events in M dwarfs. Combining Virtual Observatory capabilities to query huge amount of data and a flexible detection algorithm developed for this end, we managed to analyse millions of spectral energy distributions and obtain a sample of flaring M dwarfs. We confirmed and studied the flaring nature of these objects using low-resolution spectra collected with NOT/ALFOSC and GTC/OSIRIS, and high-cadence photometric data from TESS. This procedure, which can easily be used in other multi-filter photometric surveys, allowed the detection of episodes of strong Ca { ii} H and K line emission, which are not usually taken into account in the study of flares in large M dwarf samples and may have important implications for exoplanetary space weather and habitability studies. The results of this thesis have broad implications for both stellar and substellar astrophysics. This work has contributed to expanding the census of ultracool dwarfs, which are among the least understood populations due to their intrinsic faintness and complex atmospheres, by employing a flexible and scalable Virtual Observatory approach that integrates multi-filter photometry and astrometric data.

By identifying Ca { ii} H and K flaring M dwarfs, and a methodology to detect them in multi-filter photometric surveys, this thesis contributes to the ongoing discussion of how stellar activity affects the long-term viability of planetary systems around these stars, which are ubiquitous in the solar neighbourhood and are prime targets for exoplanet searches. A persistent challenge in stellar astrophysics is the discrepancy between synthetic models and observed spectra. By using a deep transfer learning approach to project synthetic and observed data into a common feature space, this thesis consolidates a novel approach to overcoming the gap between them, improving the reliability of parameter estimation from synthetic spectra in low-mass objects with a flexible and scalable methodology that can be easily applied to the large surveys expected in the years to come.

In this sense, future efforts should focus on scaling up these approaches and integrate them into the workflow of next-generation astronomical surveys such as J-PAS, Euclid or LSST, which will dramatically increase the amount of data available. Since machine learning pipelines will play a crucial role in managing the vast datasets produced by these missions, the techniques developed in this thesis can be adapted to upcoming surveys to automate the discovery and characterisation of low-mass stellar and substellar objects. The most direct application of the work developed in this thesis is the use of the deep transfer learning methodology presented in Chapters and for the discovery and characterisation of ultracool dwarfs in the first data release of Euclid, which will be publicly available in mid-2026. In this sense, we will go a step further in the methodology, taking advantage of the power of autoencoder architectures for outlier detection, to identify ultracool dwarfs using the whole dataset of low-resolution spectra from the Euclid wide-field spectroscopic survey. This can be achieved by using autoencoder neural networks trained with a grid of synthetic spectra, and fine-tuned with real Euclid spectra corresponding to well-known ultracool dwarfs. By analysing the reconstruction error of this system, we will study the use of a limiting value to discard all objects for which a significantly higher reconstruction error is obtained, which will make it possible to analyse huge amounts of spectroscopic data in a very efficient way, retaining only the ultracool objects of interest.

After the discovery phase, we will follow a procedure similar to that discussed in Chapter to characterise the low-resolution spectra of the identified ultracool dwarfs, creating a rich catalogue of spectroscopically characterised ultracool dwarfs that could be of great value to the astronomical community. The main strength of this methodology lies in its ability to eliminate biases that are present in other classical methodologies, in which objects are first selected on the basis of colours and then its ultracool nature is confirmed using spectra. Furthermore, we plan to test this methodology using different sets of atmosphere and evolutionary models, such as the ATMO 2020 (CITATION) , to study in detail the differences with our current setup. As the data tsunami in observational astronomy continues to grow, artificial intelligence will become increasingly essential in processing, analysing, and interpreting the information about our cosmos.

The archive also implements the SAMP\\, (Simple Application Messaging) Virtual Observatory protocol, which allows Virtual Observatory applications to communicate with each other in a seamless and transparent manner for the user.
